# DTW
Simple dynamic time warp (DTW) algorithm in Python. Performs DTW and computes the optimal alignment between two time series S and T, given as Pandas DataFrames. The “optimal” alignment minimizes the sum of distances between aligned elements. Returns the distance (using Euclidean as pointwise distance).
