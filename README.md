# NFL Big Data Bowl 2021
We propose a novel method for clustering NFL plays using Gonzalez clustering with the dynamic time warp (DTW) distance measure.

The jupyter notebook file contains our competition submission. There are additional Python files for custom built DTW and Gonzalez clustering algorithms. Data processing was largely done outside of the submitted jupyter notebook for performance.
